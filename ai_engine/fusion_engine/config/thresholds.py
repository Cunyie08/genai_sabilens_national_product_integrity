Fusion Engine - Decision Thresholds

Maps the final weighted fusion score (0-100) to a verdict.
Score thresholds, verdict bands, severity levels, and confidence labels
for the A4 Fusion Engine.

SCORE SCALE: 0.0 - 1.0 (aligned to orchestrator/pipeline.py)

VERDICT BANDS:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  >= 0.72  ->  AUTHENTIC         Safe to purchase    │
  │  0.45-0.71 ->  SUSPICIOUS       Proceed with caution│
  │  < 0.45   ->  FAKE              Do not buy. Report. │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

HARD OVERRIDE RULES (bypass score entirely, set in reg_adapter / ocr_adapter):
  Regulatory status in {AGENT_ERROR, EXPIRED} ->    force FAKE
  OCR nafdac_number = None                                      ->  floor SUSPICIOUS
  visual_similarity < 0.20                                      ->  floor SUSPICIOUS

DAMAGE IS NOT AN OVERRIDE:
  damage_score and blur_value affect WEIGHTS only, never verdict directly.
  A blurry photo of a real product must never be forced to FAKE.

SCALABILITY NOTES:
  - Threshold values are tuned after each evaluation sprint.
  - Do not hard-code 0.72 or 0.45 anywhere outside this file.
  - All code must call get_verdict(score), never compare scores inline.
  - RESCAN_REQUIRED is a special non-verdict state handled in fusion_engine.py.
    It is not scored and does not appear in THRESHOLDS.
